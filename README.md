# Set-List-Generator
Providing a csv with the title and members of a dance to generate a set list for a performance to have least overlap.


To use you provide the csv formated with the title of the dance, then the names of the performers in the dance. 

There are some generalizations to be made as this program works only for the specific use case of my performance, but I am working on generalizing it to work without constraints.
